# 2D Game (Verson 1 [Inital Release])
This is one of my first projects. This is a game I created using the fundementals and basics of the C programming language.

# How to play

### Player Configuration
Step 1: Set a character or symbol to represent your player
Step 2: Set the number of lives between 1 and 10

### Game Configuration
Step 1: Set the path length for your game
Step 2: Set the number of moves allowed between 3 and 15

### Bomb and Treasure Placement
Step 1: Set the bomb positions. Remember bombs are decoded to the 1 and no bomb is decoded to 0. Make sure to space out your numbers, and do not enter more than five numbers. (Ex: 1 0 0 1 0)

Step 2: Set the treasure positions. Remember treasure is decoded to the 1 and no treasure is decoded to 0. Make sure to space out your numbers, and do not enter more than five numbers. (Ex: 1 0 0 1 0)

### Now your ready to play!
